> *Automatically send attendance messages to Discord servers on schedule. Set it once, let it run in the background forever.*

## 🤔 What Does This Do?

**AttendanceBot** automatically sends messages (like "Present" or "Good morning") to Discord channels at times you choose. Perfect for:

- Daily attendance in Work/Study Discord servers
- Automated check-ins for games or communities
- Scheduled greetings or reminders

Once set up, it runs invisibly in the background on your computer. You can add multiple servers and multiple schedules for each server.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Multiple Servers** — Manage attendance for unlimited Discord servers
- ✅ **Multiple Schedules** — Set different times for each server (e.g., 9 AM weekdays, 8 PM weekends)
- ✅ **Anti-Detection** — Adds random delays (1-10 minutes) so messages don't post at the exact same second every day
- ✅ **Message OR Reaction** — Send text messages OR react with emojis to existing messages
- ✅ **Webhook Alerts** — Get notifications on your phone when attendance posts successfully (or if something goes wrong)
- ✅ **Background Service** — Runs 24/7 even when you close the terminal or restart your computer
- ✅ **Easy Setup** — Interactive step-by-step wizard—no coding knowledge needed

---

## 📋 What You Need Before Starting

1. **Node.js** installed on your computer ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
   - Check if you have it: Open Terminal/PowerShell and type `node -v`
   - You need version 18 or higher

2. **Your Discord User Token** ([How to get it](#-how-to-get-your-discord-token))

3. **Discord Channel ID** where you want to send attendance ([How to get it](#-how-to-get-a-channel-id))

---

## 🚀 Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Download and Install Dependencies

══════════════════════════════════════════════════

  [1] Add New Server Profile
  [2] View All Configurations
  [3] Manage / Pause / Delete Server
  [4] Update Global Webhook URL
  [5] Exit
```

**Choose option 1** to add your first server. The wizard will ask you:

1. **Discord User Token**: Paste your token (see below for how to get it)
2. **Webhook URL** (optional): Skip this for now by pressing Enter
3. **Profile Name**: Give it a nickname like "Work Server" or "Game Guild"
4. **Channel ID**: Paste the channel ID where attendance should post
5. **Schedule**:
   - Choose **1** for Everyday, **2** for Weekdays only, or **3** for Weekends only
   - Enter the time (e.g., `09:00 AM` or `21:30`)
   - Type the message to send (e.g., `Present`)
   - Set max random delay in minutes (recommended: `10` minutes)

After adding schedules, you'll be asked if you want to add more. Type `n` when you're done.

✅ **Your configuration is now saved!** The wizard creates a file called `config.json` that stores all your settings.

---

### Step 3: Start the Background Service

Now let's make the bot run continuously in the background:

```bash
npm run service:install
```

You'll see:

```
✅ Background Daemon "attendanceBot-daemon" installed and running!
📌 Commands:
  - Status : npm run service:status
  - Logs   : npm run service:logs
  - Stop   : npm run service:uninstall
```

**That's it!** AttendanceBot is now running in the background. You can close the terminal—it will keep running.

## 🔑 How to Get Your Discord Token

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Your token is like a password to your Discord account. NEVER share it with anyone. If someone gets your token, they can control your Discord account.

### Desktop App or Browser (Works on both):

1. Open Discord
2. Press **F12** (or `Ctrl + Shift + I` on Windows, `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac)
3. Click the **Console** tab at the top
4. Copy and paste this code, then press **Enter**:

```javascript
window.webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([
  [Math.random()],
  {},
  req => {
    for (const m of Object.values(req.c)) {
      if (m?.exports?.default?.getToken) {
        console.log(m.exports.default.getToken());
      }
    }
  }
]);
```

5. Your token will appear in the console (a long string of letters and numbers)
6. **Right-click** it and select **Copy**
7. Close Developer Tools

---

## 📍 How to Get a Channel ID

1. Open Discord and go to **User Settings** (gear icon)
2. Go to **Advanced** (under "APP SETTINGS")
3. Turn on **Developer Mode**
4. Go back to Discord, **right-click** any channel, and click **Copy Channel ID**

---

## 💻 Managing the Bot

### Check if the Bot is Running

```bash
npm run service:status

├─────┼──────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ 0   │ attendanceBot-daemon │ online  │ 2h 15m  │ 45.2 MB  │
└─────┴──────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
```

### View Live Logs (What's Happening Right Now)

```bash

```

Press **Ctrl + C** to stop watching logs.

### Add More Servers or Edit Schedules

```bash
npm start
```

Choose option **1** to add more servers, or option **3** to pause/resume/delete existing ones.

### Stop the Bot Completely

```bash
npm run service:uninstall
```

---

## 🔄 Make It Start Automatically When Your Computer Boots

### Windows

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
npm install -g pm2-windows-startup
pm2-startup install
```

### macOS

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
npx pm2 startup launchd
```

## 🔔 Get Notifications on Your Phone (Optional)

You can get Discord notifications on your phone whenever attendance posts successfully or if there's an error.

### How to Set Up Webhook Notifications:

1. Open Discord (desktop or browser)
2. Go to the channel where you want to receive notifications
3. Click the **gear icon** next to the channel name → **Integrations** → **Webhooks**
4. Click **New Webhook** → **Copy Webhook URL**
5. Run `npm start` → Choose **[4] Update Global Webhook URL**
6. Paste the webhook URL and press Enter
7. You'll get a test notification immediately!

Now whenever attendance posts, you'll get a notification like this:

```
✅ Attendance Posted Successfully
Server Profile : Work Server
Channel        : #daily-checkin
Schedule       : 09:00 AM (Weekdays)
Message Sent   : "Present"

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 1. Discord's Rules

Using "self-bots" (bots that control your personal Discord account) **violates Discord's Terms of Service**. While many people use them without issues, Discord *can* ban your account if they detect it.

**How to stay safer:**
- ✅ Always keep "Anti-Detection Jitter" enabled (10+ minutes recommended)
- ✅ Don't use this bot on your main Discord account
- ✅ Use it sparingly (1-2 messages per day max)
- ❌ Never post in rapid succession or across many servers

### 2. Keep Your Token Secret

Your Discord token is like your password. If someone gets it, they can:
- Read all your messages
- Send messages as you
- Join/leave servers
- Change your settings

**Never:**
- Share your token with anyone
- Post it online
- Commit `config.json` to GitHub

### 3. This is For Personal/Educational Use Only

Use this responsibly. Don't spam, don't harass, and respect the communities you're in.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"

You need to install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org/

### "Failed to log into Discord: Unauthorized"

Your Discord token is wrong or expired. Get a fresh token using the steps above.

### "Channel not found" or "Missing Permissions"

Make sure:
1. The Channel ID is correct
2. Your Discord account has permission to send messages in that channel
3. The channel still exists

### Bot stops working after a few days

Check logs with `npm run service:logs`. Common causes:
- Discord token expired (get a new one)
- Channel was deleted
- You got rate-limited (reduce frequency or increase jitter)

### How do I update the bot?

```bash
cd attendanceBot
git pull
npm install
npm run service:uninstall
npm run service:install
```

## 🛠️ Advanced: Reaction-Based Attendance

Some servers require you to react with an emoji instead of sending a message.

When setting up a schedule, you can:
1. Set `attendanceType` to `REACTION` in `config.json`
2. Add `"emoji": "👍"` (or any emoji)
3. Optionally add `"targetMessageId": "1234567890"` to react to a specific message

Example in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "1234567891",
  "label": "09:00 AM (Weekdays)",
  "cron": "0 9 * * 1-5",
  "attendanceType": "REACTION",
  "emoji": "✅",
  "targetMessageId": "1234567890123456789",
  "maxJitterMinutes": 10,
  "active": true
}
```

If `targetMessageId` is not provided, the bot will react to the most recent message in the channel.
